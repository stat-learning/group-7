# College characteristics and post-graduate employment

## Group members

Alice Chang, Ben Thomas, and Olek Wojcik

## Project description

#### Question: 

What are the major determinants of the employment rate of graduates from a given college, 6 months after graduation? 

#### Model type

This would be a regression model with the graduate employment rate as the dependent variable. Inferential.

#### Data

Data would be available through most rankings publications. U.S. News publishes data on most colleges and universities, which we could access through their "College Compass" tool. Additionally, we would use data from IPEDS (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data).
